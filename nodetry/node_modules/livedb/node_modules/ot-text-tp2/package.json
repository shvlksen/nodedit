  "readme": "# TP2 Text OT type\n\nThis is an implementation of OT for text which implements [transform property\n2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation#Convergence_properties)\nthrough the use of tombstones. As such, this data structure can be used in\npeer-to-peer situations (with concurrency control algorithms which do not have\na single source of truth).\n\nThis code following this spec from lightwave:\nhttp://code.google.com/p/lightwave/source/browse/trunk/experimental/ot/README\n\nDocuments are a string with tombstones inserted throughout. For example, 'some\n', (2 tombstones), 'string'. Tombstones indicate positions where characters\nonce existed. They are important for many parties to agree on convergence.\n\nThis is encoded in a document as ['some ', (2 tombstones), 'string']\n(It should be encoded as {s:'some string', t:[5, -2, 6]} because thats\nfaster in JS, but its not.)\n\nJust like in the 'normal' [plaintext type](/ottypes/text), Ops are lists of\ncomponents which iterate over the whole document.\n\nComponents are either:\n\nCompoent   | Description\n---------- | ------------\n`N`        | Skip N characters in the original document\n`{i:'str'}`| Insert 'str' at the current position in the document\n`{i:N}`    | Insert N tombstones at the current position in the document\n`{d:N}`    | Delete (tombstone) N characters at the current position in the document\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n[3, {i:'hi'}, 5, {d:8}]\n```\n\nSnapshots are lists with characters and tombstones. Characters are stored in strings\nand adjacent tombstones are flattened into numbers.\n\nEg, the document: 'Hello .....world' ('.' denotes tombstoned (deleted) characters)\nwould be represented by a document snapshot of ['Hello ', 5, 'world']\n\n\n---\n\n# License\n\nAll code contributed to this repository is licensed under the standard MIT license:\n\nCopyright 2011 ottypes library contributors\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following condition:\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
